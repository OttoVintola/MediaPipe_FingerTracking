## Overview

This was a quick project I did to track fingers in a video feed. The project uses OpenCV but mainly I wanted to try Google's MediaPipe library (https://mediapipe.dev/). I wanted to see how far CV development has come and how easy it is to use these libraries.

## Future 

Personally, I think it would be cool to use this project to write sentences or communicate somehow. Maybe in the future I will add a feature to track the hand and write letters on the screen.
